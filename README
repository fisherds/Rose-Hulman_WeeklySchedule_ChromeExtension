Rose-Hulman Weekly Schedule Chrome Extension

The purpose of this Chrome Extension is mainly to learn.  The goal is to use Google's
Closure tools to create a fun extension.  This project uses Ant to build the extension,
generate the soy js, and create a .zip to upload to the Chrome store.

The things I hope to learn include:
 - Creating a set of tools to effectively use Closure
   - This includes Ant, Eclipse, etc.
 - Learn to use the Closure library
   - Focus on UI controls
   - All sorts of other things :)

What the finished extension will do:
 - Display a browser action popup with a simple grid of classes
 - Provide a mechanism to fill the schedule by clicking a cell
 - Save the schedule
 - Be pretty
 - Update the clock based on Rose time
