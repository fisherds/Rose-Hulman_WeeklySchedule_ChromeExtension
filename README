Rose-Hulman Weekly Schedule Chrome Extension

The purpose of this Chrome Extension is mainly to learn.  The goal is to use Google
Closure tools to create a fun extension.  This project uses Ant to build the extension,
generate the soy js, and create a .zip to upload to the Chrome store.

The things I hope to learn include:
 - Creating a set of tools to effectively use Closure
   - This includes Ant, Eclipse, Soy, closurebuilder, depswriter, compiled vs uncompiled code, etc.
 - Learning to use the Closure library
   - Subclassing Control and Container UI controls
   - Using some built in UI controls (color picker, dialog, things tbd)
   - MVC development with closure
   - All sorts of other things
 - Chrome Extensions
   - Uploading extensions to the store
   - Data persistence with Extensions
   - Browser Actions with popups
 - App Engine
   - Stretch goal to do some advanced development with an app engine as the server

What the finished extension will do:
 - Display a browser action popup with a simple grid of classes
 - Provide a mechanism to manually fill the schedule by clicking a cell and editing properties
 - Provide a mechanism to automatically fill the schedule via the Rose Schedule Lookup page
 - Save the schedule
 - Be pretty
 - Update the clock based on Rose time
 - Stretch goal to let you look at other people's schedules to find meeting times
 - Stretch goal to save prior quarters / automatically load all prior quarters
